# Atlas OS & P3 Protocol: The Sovereign Digital Substrate

> A high-performance, post-quantum, and zero-knowledge grid for the decentralized web. Atlas is not an app; it is the execution layer where privacy is the law and performance is the baseline.

## Core Philosophy

- **[Constraint Architecture](./docs/advanced/SECURITY.md)**: The system welcomes extension but prevents corruption. Security is baked into the "physics" of the protocol.
- **[Wallet-Anchored Sovereignty](./docs/SESSION_BRIDGE.md)**: Every session, file, and byte is tied to a user-owned identity. The server is a blind relay; the user is the Master Control Program.
- **[8-Lane Grid](./docs/advanced/INFRASTRUCTURE.md#8-lane-protocol)**: Multiplexed transport ensuring that heavy media (4K) never blocks essential control signals.

## Primary Infrastructure

- **[Atlas Transport Protocol](./docs/ATLAS_TRANSPORT.md)**: Technical spec for the 8-lane multiplexed communication grid. Fixes Head-of-Line blocking for P2P mesh.
- **[ZK-Receipt Notary](./docs/advanced/SECURITY.md#zero-knowledge-proofs)**: Groth16 ZK-SNARK implementation for mathematical privacy. Verify ownership without revealing identity.
- **[Immune System / Rules Engine](./docs/advanced/AUTOMATION.md#rules-engine)**: The self-healing logic of the grid. Automated monitoring and rerouting for 100% uptime.
- **[Post-Quantum Identity](./docs/advanced/SECURITY.md#post-quantum-kyber)**: Migration logic for Kyber-1024 lattice-based encryption. Built for the Quantum Winter.
- **[Meta-Adapter Orchestration](./docs/INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md)**: The bridge between Web2 legacy APIs and the P3 Sovereign Mesh.

## Key Capabilities

- **[Decentralized EPG](./docs/advanced/INFRASTRUCTURE.md#decentralized-epg)**: Real-time IPTV and program discovery without central servers via catalogSyncCursors.
- **[Sovereign Persona](./docs/SESSION_BRIDGE.md)**: Wallet-anchored session states using TweetNaCl authenticated encryption.
- **[Immutable Audit Trail](./docs/advanced/AUTOMATION.md#immutable-audit-sequences)**: Strictly incrementing ledger sequences for verifiable database integrity.
- **[PWA Re-Materialization](./docs/advanced/INFRASTRUCTURE.md#pwa-cache-protection)**: Self-cleaning version protection to prevent "Grid" corruption at the browser level.

## Optional & Secondary Modules

- **[Legacy Bridge](./docs/CROSS_CHAIN_BRIDGE.md)**: Finality-aware adapters for Base, Polygon, Arbitrum, and Optimism.
- **[Telemetry Hashing](./docs/advanced/SECURITY.md#privacy-preserving-telemetry)**: Privacy-first fraud detection using uaHash and hashedIp.
- **[Enterprise Sandbox](./docs/advanced/ENTERPRISE.md#tenant-sandbox)**: Multi-tenant isolation for sovereign organizations.
